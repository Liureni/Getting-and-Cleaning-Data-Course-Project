# Project Description
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Collection of the raw data
The dataset was downloaded from the provided link https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

## Abbreviations
* t or Time stands for 'time' 
* f or Freq stands for 'frequency'
* Body = related to body movement
* Gravity = acceleration of gravity
* Acc = accelerometer measurement
* Gyro = gyroscopic measurements
* Jerk = sudden movement acceleration
* Mag = magnitude of movement
* mean and std (=standard deviation) are calculated for each subject for each activity for each mean and SD measurements.

## Activity Labels
* `WALKING` (value `1`): subject was walking during the test
* `WALKING_UPSTAIRS` (value `2`): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
* `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS` (value `3`): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
* `SITTING` (value `4`): subject was sitting during the test
* `STANDING` (value `5`): subject was standing during the test
* `LAYING` (value `6`): subject was laying down during the test

## All variables

* `x_train`, `y_train`, `x_test`, `y_test`, `subject_train` and `subject_test` are generated using the read.table function by passing the downloaded data from the course project page.
* `x_data`, `y_data` and `subject_data` are the merged data from the previosly mentioned data sets, which were separated for the experiment purposes but that we need in one single data set.
* The `features` variable is created by loading the `features.txt` file and contains the column names that the data represents
* The `activities` variable is created in a similar fashion, and it contains the appropiate name sof the activities that were captured during the experiment and that we will use to group the observations for our calculations
* The `all_data` variable is a merge of all the data variables, and its created in order to be used to calculate the means of each observation.
* The `averages_data` variable is created with a subset of columns from the `all_data` variable, by grouping the data by the Subject and Activity columns and calculating the means of each of its columns, using the ddply function, which was loaded at the beginning of the script.
